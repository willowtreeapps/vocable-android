## What is Vocable?
Vocable AAC allows those with conditions such as MS, stroke, ALS, or spinal cord injuries to communicate using an app that tracks head movements, without the need to spend tens of thousands of dollars on technology to do so.

## Features

### Multimodal User Interface

Vocable uses ARCore to track the user's head movements and understand where the user is looking at on the screen. This allows the app to be used completely hands-free: users can look around the screen and make selections by lingering their gaze at a particular element. 

For users with more mobility, the app can be operated by touch.

### Saved Phrases
Use a list of common phrases provided by speech language pathologists, or create and save your own.

### Full QWERTY Keyboard
Type with your head or your hands.

## Roadmap
For the current progress on features, please visit the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/willowtreeapps/projects/50/views/1).

For a high-level roadmap, see the [Vocable Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md)

## Translations
We'd love to translate Vocable into as many languages as possible. If you'd like to help translate, please visit our [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/vocable-android). Thanks for helping people communicate all around the world! üåéüåçüåè

## Contributing
We love contributions! To get started, please see our [Contributing Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Feature Flags
Vocable uses a feature flag system to manage the rollout of new features. There are two types of flags:

1. **Build-time Flags**: Configured in `app/build.gradle` and controlled via build configuration. These are typically used for features that should be enabled/disabled based on the build type (debug/release).

2. **Runtime Flags**: Managed through `SharedPreferences` and can be toggled at runtime. These are useful for features that need to be controlled dynamically, such as through a debug menu.

To add a new feature flag:
1. Add the build configuration in `app/build.gradle` if needed
2. Declare the flag in `app/src/main/java/com/willowtree/vocable/utils/features/FeatureFlags.kt`
3. Use `FeatureFlags.YOUR_FLAG.enabled` to check the flag state
